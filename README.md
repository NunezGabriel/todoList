# JS TODO List

Create a ToDo list using HTML, CSS, and JS only.

The application should have a `form` to create a new task setting the message and the due date of it.

After being created it should be listed below the `form` along with a `button` to mark it as complete.


The application should use semantic HTML and have your own CSS to style the list.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
